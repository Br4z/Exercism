# Exercism

This repository contains all the exercises I have done on the [Exercism](https://exercism.org/dashboard) platform. Each solution (with its respective files) also contains the last date when it was verified that it still works, this is because the exercise statement may change, so it is possible that my solution "breaks" in the new version. With the date you can go to the previous statement, for which my solution was made.
